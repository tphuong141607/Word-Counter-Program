# yesCODE--Word-Counter-Program

The program shall count all characters, words, and lines of the input text file. After doing all the calculations, the program stores the results into another text file with the name provided by the user. This word counter was created on May 9, 2019, using C language. It behaves exactly like the word counting service in this [website](https://wordcounter.net/character-count)

# Example:
Note: in the `code` folder, there is a `textFile.txt` for testing purpose. 

Getting file names from the user:
